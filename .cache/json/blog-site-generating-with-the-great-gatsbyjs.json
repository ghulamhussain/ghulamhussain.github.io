{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Site generating with the great GatsbyJS","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When someone mentions static site generation many people think ofÂ <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jekyll</a>. I had heard some good things about it and noticed it would allow me to build a blog quite easily. I was eager to learn something new and get something up and running that was more than just my usual WordPress theme. I was on the verge of rebuilding my portfolio site until a certain <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/LevelUpTuts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scott Tolinski </a>released a video on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/b2H7fWhQcdE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GatsbyJS</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GatsbyJS</a> is a static site generator, similar to Jekyll, however it is written using <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">React</a> and allows you to write your pages as React components! It is somewhat similar to create-react-app where almost all the scary Webpack config has been abstracted away from you and everything is setup ready to go, so you can get to the important stuff like&#8230;building the site! (If you are a fan of React and not convinced, the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">React website/docs</a>Â were just released using Gatsby!)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This caught my attention for multiple reasons. I wanted to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be able to build a new site with a blog relatively quickly</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Have a site that loads quickly/is performant</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Learn some more React and JavaScript</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another reason I ended up going with Gatsby was the promise that your project could be connected to various APIs or even a CMS of your choice.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The magic of GraphQL and Gatsby Plugins</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Originally, following Scott&#8217;s and the official Gatsby tutorial, I had it pulling my content from good ol&#8217; Markdown files. Then I saw it&#8230; too good to be true, the mention of connecting it to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress</a>&#8230; I have been writing WordPress themes for almost 2 years now, so this got me super excited. To have my back-end as WordPress (including <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACF</a>) and the front-end in React, I had found the perfect place to test my front-end abilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I was skeptical at first: would I have to parse large amounts of JSON to get the data I needed? I have never even interacted with the WordPress REST API, how will I query it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The answer&#8230; <a href=\"http://graphql.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GraphQL</a>. Gatsby ships with it and through an npm install of a <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gatsby-source plugin</a> of your choice and a tiny bit of a config, you can start querying in no time. I was amazed with how simple queries are using GraphQL. You look at them and you go &#8220;Huh, that&#8217;s it? Really?&#8221;. Gatsby even ships with an in-browser query tester so you can see exactly what data you are getting from your GraphQL queries. Wanna sort those blog posts by date? No problem, just add a flag.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wrap up and future</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In just a few weekends I managed to rebuild my portfolio site with the blog I wanted. I&#8217;d highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/\">Gatsby</a>Â for anyone who has started getting acquainted with React. Before I started this project I didn&#8217;t know a lot about:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Static site generation</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creating a Progressive Web App (PWA) and what qualifies as one</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">React Router</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GraphQL</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WordPress REST API</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moving forward I&#8217;d like to extend the project to include pagination within the blog, use <a href=\"https://www.styled-components.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Styled Components</a> and ensure the site scores a 90+ overall on <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lighthouse</a> (Google performance auditing tool)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">tl;dr &#8211; Side projects are great and you can learn a lot from them. Stay in the loop and listen to others whether that be watching tutorials, listening to podcasts, following devs on twitter, reading articles on </span><a href=\"http://dev.to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">dev.to</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, blogs etc. #neverstoplearning</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are like me, learn something, build something, even if it&#8217;s small, then write about it, then you&#8217;ll have a first blog post, just like this one ðŸ˜€</span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>When someone mentions static site generation many people think ofÂ Jekyll.
